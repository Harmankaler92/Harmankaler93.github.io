<h1 class="heading">Intermittent fasting to lose weights: Methods and benefits</h1>

<p id="para1">Intermittent fasting is an eating plan that will help you lose weight naturally. It is mainly based on programming
fasting periods and feeding periods. This strategy has multiple health benefits. Intermittent fasting consists of alternating fasting times and feeding times, there are strategies widely recognized for
their health benefits such as fasting 16/8, fasting (eating-stop-eating) 24, and fasting 5: 2 that will allow you to
perform intermittent fasting easily and simply.<br></p>

<p id="para2">These easy strategies will allow you to fast intelligently to lose weight without risk to your health. During the first
days of fasting, your body will begin to adapt to new changes and for this reason, the days can be difficult, but after
your body gets used to intermittent fasting, you can do it constantly until you achieve your goal: lose weight.</p>

    A. Method 16/8 is the most used strategy for intermittent fasting. This method consists of skipping breakfast and eating
food for 8 hours, a good strategy is to start eating from 2 pm to 10 pm, with this method you will achieve fasting for
16 hours.</p>


<p>
B. Method of fasting eat-stop-eat (fasting 24 hours): Fasting 24 hours should be done twice a week. This method can begin
by skipping dinner and fasting until the next day. This method of fasting will enhance the effect of ketosis and weight
loss.</p>


<p>
 C. 5: 2 diet: This method consists of restricting the consumption of calories for two days to minimum amounts that only
allow the body to function (600 calories). You must fast for 2 days and eat normally for the next 5 days. It should be
clarified that the diet must be completely healthy.</p>

Why should intermittent fasting be practiced?
Intermittent fasting considerably reduces the calories ingested, favoring weight loss, and loss of belly fat. Normally
the body uses glucose or glycogen for energy when food is not consumed for several hours but intermittent fasting
activates a metabolic process called ketosis.
This metabolic process uses the body's stored fats to produce energy. During intermittent fasting, the accumulated fat
is used to produce energy. Fasting should be intermittent, thus reducing the risk of losing muscle mass and healthily
losing weight.
Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting are two important requirements for weight loss but also promote insulin
sensitivity and improve growth hormone secretion, two important factors for weight loss.</p>

<h2> 3 Health benefits of intermittent fasting </h2>

<p class="6"> Improve your digestion
Intermittent fasting and a healthy eating plan will help improve your digestion, avoid the impact of gastrointestinal
reflux and constipation. [1]</p>

<h3>2. Reduces cholesterol levels</h3>
<p class="7">
Decreasing the consumption of saturated fats will help reduce cholesterol and improve cardiovascular health. During
intermittent fasting decreases the intestinal absorption of fats, preventing the accumulation of cholesterol. [2]</p>

<h3>3. Reduce inflammation</h3>
<p class="8">
Fasting works to lose weight and avoid eating processed foods with high amounts of chemical preservatives. It is
necessary to accompany the fast with a healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables, and green leaves to enhance the
detoxifying effect in the blood and reduce inflammation markers. [3]</p>

<strong> these 6 mistakes if you want to lose weight without exercising with intermittent fasting</strong>

<h3>1. Choose the wrong plan</h3>
<p class="9">
There are several types of intermittent fasting, although the most popular is 8/16, which consists of fasting for 16
hours to eat all our requirements in 8. That is if the last meal we do at 9:00 p.m. The day before, we couldn't eat
again until 1:00 p.m. There are also other protocols, such as fasting 24 hours a day or fasting 5: 2, where we eat most
of the calories we need for five days, and the other two we reduce them drastically to 600 or 800. We have to be careful
and choose the plan that best suits our lifestyle, taking into account conditions such as work, family, leisure ...
</p>

<h3>2. Do it too soon</h3>

<p class="10">
If you are a person used to eating every two or three hours, it can be difficult (and a lot) to follow the rules of the
intermittent fasting plan, even the least complicated one, which is 8/16. Give the body time to adjust: a good option is
to start eating only three meals a day, well separated, to accustom the body to be a little hungry or to start with a
12/12 protocol in which you are simply 12 hours without eating. Set your goals, but don't set unreachable goals.</p>

<h3>3. Give up the first few changes</h3>
<p class="11">
Intermittent fasting requires some discipline, but as we've mentioned earlier, it also takes some getting used to. The
first four or five days are the hardest. You may feel hungry, dizzy, exhausted, or have headaches. These feelings pass
quickly and towards the end of the first week, your body will begin to adjust. Your hunger will decrease and you will
begin to feel more energetic and focused. If you don't feel better after the first week, you may have chosen a plan that
doesn't work or just doesn't suit you.</p>

<h3>4. Eat a lot</h3>
<p class="12">
One of the great benefits of intermittent fasting is the ability to eat the filling and satisfying meals without having
to dwell too long on counting the calories you eat. However, you can make the mistake of eating unhealthy foods (pizzas,
hamburgers, ultra-processed, industrial pastries ...) if you are too hungry, and that is because the plan you have
chosen may not be the most appropriate. Keep in mind that, even if you practice this diet, it does not exempt you from
choosing healthy foods such as oily fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, eggs ...</p>

<h3>5. Eat less</h3>
<p class="13">
The recommended calories for the vast majority of people are around 2,000 calories a day, although of course, this
depends on many factors: if you want to lose weight, lose fat, increase your muscle mass ... it is never advisable to
consume less than 1,500 calories a day. If you don't eat enough, you will feel especially hungry the next day, which can
affect your ability to function at work and in life in general, and you may end up breaking the plan.</p>

<h3>6. Wrong foods</h3>
<p class="14">
As we have mentioned before, and in line with the possibility of ingesting too many calories during intermittent
fasting, you may choose the wrong and unhealthy foods. Make sure you are getting enough protein, healthy fats, fiber,
and complex carbohydrates. This will fill you up longer, continue to help you build muscle, keep your brain healthy, and
make you feel more energetic and happier overall.</p>
